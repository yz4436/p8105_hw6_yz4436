### Problem 1

To obtain a distribution for $\hat{r}^2$, we'll follow basically the same procedure we used for regression coefficients: draw bootstrap samples; the a model to each; extract the value I'm concerned with; and summarize. Here, we'll use `modelr::bootstrap` to draw the samples and `broom::glance` to produce `r.squared` values. 

```{r weather_df, cache = TRUE}
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```


```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 1000) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x) ),
    results = map(models, broom::glance)) %>% 
  select(-strap, -models) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = r.squared)) + geom_density()
```

In this example, the $\hat{r}^2$ value is high, and the upper bound at 1 may be a cause for the generally skewed shape of the distribution. If we wanted to construct a confidence interval for $R^2$, we could take the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the estimates across bootstrap samples. However, because the shape isn't symmetric, using the mean +/- 1.96 times the standard error probably wouldn't work well.

We can produce a distribution for $\log(\beta_0 * \beta1)$ using a similar approach, with a bit more wrangling before we make our plot.

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 1000) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x) ),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-strap, -models) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  select(id = `.id`, term, estimate) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = term, 
    values_from = estimate) %>% 
  rename(beta0 = `(Intercept)`, beta1 = tmin) %>% 
  mutate(log_b0b1 = log(beta0 * beta1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log_b0b1)) + geom_density()
```

As with $r^2$, this distribution is somewhat skewed and has some outliers. 

The point of this is not to say you should always use the bootstrap -- it's possible to establish "large sample" distributions for strange parameters / values / summaries in a lot of cases, and those are great to have. But it is helpful to know that there's a way to do inference even in tough cases. 

## Problem 2

Import the raw dataset.
```{r}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO, Tulsa, AL. Changing type of victim_age to numeric and selecting victim_race that contains white and black only.

```{r }
homicide_df =
  homicide_df %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
    be_solve = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0)
  ) %>%
  filter(
    !city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"),
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    victim_age = ifelse(victim_age == "Unknown", 1, as.numeric(victim_age)),
    victim_sex = ifelse(victim_sex == "Unknown", 1, victim_sex)
  ) %>%
  filter(
    victim_age != 1,
    victim_sex != 1)
```


Selecting the city of Baltimore, MD. 
```{r}
baltimore = 
  homicide_df %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")
```

Use the glm function to fit a logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors. Save the output of glm as an R object; apply the broom::tidy to this object; and obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims keeping all other variables fixed.

```{r}
fit_logistic = 
  baltimore %>% 
  glm(be_solve ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial()) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    lower = exp(estimate - qnorm(0.975)*(std.error)),
    upper = exp(estimate + qnorm(0.975)*(std.error))
  ) %>%
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

fit_logistic
```

* The OR is 0.428 and 95% confidence interval is (0.326, 0.561).
